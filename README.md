# EngineersUnited
Engineers stand united in fighting back against horrible behavior. Men, women, and non-binary software engineers will not tolerate our colleagues being sexually harrassed or mis-treated. We will not tolerate sexist, racist, or trans-phobic practices. To that end we will not use the services of, nor will we work for, companies who do not follow the law, their own stated HR practices, and common human respect.

To sign the pledge please submit a pull request or file an issue in this repository. Companies will be added as people come forward and stories are verified. 

I pledge to boycott, not work for, and and get my friends and family to join me in boycotting the following companies:

* Uber

I further pledge to monitor this list and increase the companies I boycott as the list grows.

Sincerely,

#EngineersUnited
